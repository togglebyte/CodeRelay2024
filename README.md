# CodeRelay2024

This is a code relay.

## How does it work?

One participant starts by creating a new project.
No one knows what the project is supposed to (except the first participant, but
that probably becomes irrelevant soon enough).

The participant works on the project live on Twitch for three hours, the commits the code and raids the next participant.

As a participant you have three hours to make an assumption of what the code is
supposed to do and start contributing.

## The spirit of the relay

This is supposed to be funny and entertaining.
You don't have to be a 10x dev or a 1%-er to participate.

It's okay to modify code committed by others before you but try to keep the
changes to others code to a minimum if possible.

## The "rules"

These are more guidelines than rules, but try to keep with the spirit of the
relay.

* No watching the other participants
* Cross platform
* Stream for three hours working on the code then commit and push
* Raid the next person in line if they are streaming
* Absolutely NO comments in the code
* The code has to compile before handover
* Zero deps
* Rust lang only (sorry)
* No build.rs
